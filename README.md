# Solar Starship - Space Flight Simulator

A 3D space flight simulator inspired by Elite Dangerous, built with Babylon.js and React. Experience immersive space exploration with realistic physics, beautiful starfields, and interactive spaceship controls.

## Features

- **3D Space Environment**: Immersive 3D space scene with stars, planets, and nebulas
- **Interactive Spaceship**: Detailed spaceship model with animated engines
- **First-Person Controls**: Smooth camera movement and rotation
- **Real-time HUD**: Live ship status display (speed, altitude, fuel, shields)
- **Weapon System**: Fire laser beams with spacebar
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Cyberpunk-inspired interface with glowing elements

## Controls

- **W/S**: Move forward/backward
- **A/D**: Move left/right
- **Q/E**: Move up/down
- **Mouse**: Look around (camera rotation)
- **Spacebar**: Fire weapons

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18
- **3D Engine**: Babylon.js 6.0
